## Decorators

> A function that adds metadata to a class, its members (properties, methods) and function arguments.
> 
> Decorators are an experimental (stage 2), JavaScript language [feature](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators). TypeScript adds support for decorators.

Also known as an `annotation`

Note:
Angular uses decorators extensively to create `directives`, `services`, etc.
