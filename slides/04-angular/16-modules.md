## Modules

> Helps you organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. An Angular module identifies the components, directives, and pipes that the application uses along with the list of external Angular modules that the application needs, such as FormsModule.

Note:

Every Angular application has an application root-module class. By convention, the class is called AppModule and resides in a file named app.module.ts.

Modules use `NgModule` decorator

A feature module delivers a cohesive set of functionality focused on an application business domain, user workflow, facility (forms, http, routing), or collection of related utilities.
