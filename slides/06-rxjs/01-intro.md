## Introduction to RxJS

> RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. 

- Observable
- Subscription

Note:

In computing, reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm oriented around data streams and the propagation of change.

What does that mean?!

An event happens somewhere and an object responds to that event.

2 players in reactive programming: producer and consumer

Producer "emits" events to the stream
Consumer has a subscription to the stream and reacts to new data
